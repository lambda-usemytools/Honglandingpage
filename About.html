            <h1>ABOUT USE MY TOOL</h1>
            <P>We understand that as people we are all busy to carry too many stuffs and sometimes we just do not want to. Have you ever spent 20 minutes staring at your full closet every moring just because you do not know what to wear while others are in need of more clothes? We wonder why don't people share with each other so that we all just need to buy one. That's the sharing economy we love, the sense of community we want to create.
            </p> 
            <p><i>And so we created Use My Tool where people can borrow tools from others, where it is perceived 'less is more'.
