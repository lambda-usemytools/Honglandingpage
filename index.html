          <p>
            When you create an account with Use My Tools you can easily add of the tools that you have in your garage. When you add those tools you can choose if you want to be available to your garage only, your network, or out for rental. When an item is available to your garage only, it will not show up as available in any searches when someone is looking to borrow or rent a tool. A tool that is added for your network can be loaned out to anyone you have chosent to add to your network. You might not get paid for loaning out tools to your network, but hopefully they will return the favor.

          <p>
            A tool that is added for rental will show up when local Use My Tools users search for that tool. If that user likes the price you have set and wants to rent that tool from you, they will be able to request it. Once they request it, you will see their profile and their previous reviews. If you agree to rent the tool to that person, Use My Tools will process the payment and hold a deposit in escrow. You and the borrower will agree on a pickup and drop off location and the borrower will get your tool for the amount of time agreed upon.
